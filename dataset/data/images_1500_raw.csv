Much of his literary work is lost, but about thirty short poems and various prose works survive, including The History of the World. He organised and financed a number of expeditions to North America, and in later life made several unsuccessful attempts to find gold in South America. The family home was at Sherborne Castle, in Dorset. Implicated in a plotting against James I, Ralegh spent much of the Kings reign in the Tower. He was executed for treason in 1618.

Katherine of Aragon, queen of England, was the youngest daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. She was named Catalina (or Katherine as she was known in England) after her maternal great-grandmother. She came to England in 1501, aged fifteen, to marry Arthur, Prince of Wales, but only months after the marriage Arthur died. In 1509 she married Arthur's younger brother, Henry VIII. They had five children, of whom only Princess Mary, later Mary I of England, survived. Katherine died in 1536, firm in her refusal to relinquish her title as queen of England, despite Henry VIII's annulment of their union and remarriage to Anne Boleyn in 1533.

Henry VIII's sixth and last wife was a learned and pious woman, who had a moderating influence on the ageing king. Katherine showed great kindness to the king's children by his earlier marriages (Mary, Elizabeth and Edward), and tried to diminish religious persecution. After Henry's death, she married Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley in 1547, but she died a year later, shortly after giving birth to a daughter.

Prince Salim, later known by his imperial name Jahangir, ('Conqueror of the World'), was the fourth Mughal Emperor who reigned for 22 years until his death in 1625. Born in Fatehpur Sikri to Emperor Akbar and Jodha Bai, he was named after Sheikh Salim Chisti, a holy man whose spiritual help was sought by Akbar to conceive a son after the death of his previous heirs in infancy. During Jahangir's reign the Mughal Empire expanded and flourished. Though a Muslim, his personal beliefs did not obstruct state policies. Sovereignty, according to Jahangir's memoirs was a ""gift of God"" to ""ensure the contentment of the world"" and not necessarily to enforce God's law. Notable for his patronage of the arts, the distinctive style of Mughal miniature painting was popularised under his reign. Jahangir's majestic mausoleum is located in Lahore. He was succeeded by his son Prince Khurram who took the title of Shah Jahan ('King of the World')."

The son of Mary, Queen of Scots and Lord Darnley, James was crowned King of Scotland in 1567, at the age of one on the abdication of his mother, and the country was run until his majority by a succession of Protestant Regents. He succeeded Elizabeth I in 1603. His commitment to peace and reconciliation balanced religious divisions, and he successfully held the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland together under one ruler for the first time. Intelligent and scholarly, his greatest act of cultural patronage was probably the 'King James' translation of the Bible (1611). James's financial incompetence and his devotion to a succession of male favourites fuelled his critics, particularly after his death.

Guy Fawkes was a member of a group of Roman Catholic revolutionaries who planned to carry out the Gunpowder plot. Their aim was to kill the king and most of the Protestant aristocracy by blowing up the Houses of Parliament during the state opening on 5 November 1605. Fawkes was by profession a soldier, who had fought for the armies of Catholic Spain in the Netherlands. He was recruited by Robert Catesby, the lead figure in devising the plan, because of his military experience. The plot was foiled shortly before its intended completion, as Fawkes was captured while guarding the gunpowder. On discovery, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, tried for treason and executed.

The only son of Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, Edward succeeded his father in 1547 aged nine. Scholarly and firmly Protestant, he ruled during his minority with the help of a council, but was dominated by the policies of his two Protestant Protectors, first Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset and then John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. The latter induced Edward to will the crown to Lady Jane Grey, in order to ensure the Protestant succession. Edward died of tuberculosis shortly before his sixteenth birthday.

Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, was the first cousin and second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, and the father of her son James VI of Scotland. He had claims to both the Scottish and English thrones and became aware of his inheritance and status from an early age. He married Mary, Queen of Scots in 1565 and their son, James, was born the following year.

The daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth came to the throne on the death of her half-sister, Mary I. Her long reign, beginning in 1558, saw the secure establishment of the Church of England. It was characterised by relative peace and prosperity, a great increase in foreign trade and exploration, and a flourishing literary culture. Despite receiving many proposals of marriage, Elizabeth remained single and became legendary as the 'virgin queen'. She had many favourites, but none more important than Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, who sought to win her hand in marriage.

As one of the most powerful noblemen in Elizabethan England, Thomas Howard played a critical role in English history. A direct rival of the Earl of Leicester, he was appointed as a Privy Councillor and served as Earl Marshall of England, supervising the funeral rites of Mary I and the coronation of Elizabeth I. However, his ambition and pro-Catholic interests meant he became the focus of plots and religious dissent, which ultimately led to his downfall. His secret plan to marry Mary Queen of Scots and the central part he played in the plot to ensure her succession to the throne, led to his dramatic fall from grace in 1571. He was executed for treason in 1572.

He was the second son of the poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and the younger brother of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. After the discovery of his brother's plot to wed Mary, Queen of Scots, he was arrested more than once on suspicion of harbouring treasonable intentions.

The most celebrated English playwright and poet, Shakespeare is held as one of the greatest writers of all time. Born in Stratford-upon-Avon, he spent most of his working life in London, first as an actor, then a playwright. Whereas many poets of the time were wealthy amateurs, dramatists were usually professionals whose income came from supplying plays to the public theatres and court. The texts of plays belonged to the theatres and were seen as ephemeral, soon to be replaced. The publication of Ben Jonson's Workes in 1616, and in 1623 his own Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, Tragedies (the 'First Folio'), were milestones in the recognition of plays as lasting, influential works of literature.

The son of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Philip married Mary I against the wishes of Parliament and people in 1554. A deeply religious man, he subsequently made an offer of marriage to Elizabeth after Mary's death, with the proviso that she must convert to Roman Catholicism. He was reluctant to go to war against England thirty years later, and claimed that his motivation was the re-conversion of the country to Catholicism. However, issues of reputation and defence were of equal, if not greater, importance.

Outliving all of Henry VIII's wives, Anne of Cleves was the Queen of England for a brief six months, while married to the King. The wedding was encouraged by Thomas Cromwell and the House of Cleves, both seeking a strong alliance in Europe. Hans Holbein the Younger was sent to paint portraits of Anne and her sister for Henry's consideration, who came to consider the likeness poor and complain that she was plain and uneducated. Despite his resistance, the marriage went ahead on January 6 1540, but was annulled on the grounds that it was unconsummated in July of the same year. Anne received Hever House in the settlement and remained on good terms with Henry, often being referred to as the King's beloved sister.

The daughter of Frederick II of Denmark, Anne married James VI of Scotland in 1589. During her time in Scotland she converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism, but James allowed her to practise in private, and her early life with him was relatively happy. Anne and James had seven children, although only Henry, Elizabeth and Charles lived beyond early childhood. In England, Anne made an important contribution to the social and cultural life at court, commissioning artists and writers - most notably Ben Jonson, composers and choreographers, as well as collecting art, particularly portraiture.

Margaret Tudor was the elder of the two surviving daughters of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. She was the elder sister of Henry VIII. In 1503 she married James IV, King of Scots, thus becoming the mother of James V and grandmother of Mary, Queen of Scots. Importantly, Margaret's marriage to James led directly to the Union of the Crowns. Margaret was married three times, and her history in this regard might be said to parallel that of her granddaughter, Mary Stuart, with its liberal mixture of tragedy, intrigue, duplicity and simple farce."

Thomas Chaloner was a talented diplomat and scholar who served under four Tudor monarchs. He survived shipwreck off the cost of Algeria in 1541, and was knighted after fighting in England's defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Pinkie, 1547.

To many of his contemporaries Philip Sidney represented the ideal of the renaissance courtier. He was a soldier, diplomat and author who became one of the most influential Elizabethan poets. He is known particularly for his prose romance Arcadia and the sonnet sequence Astrophel and Stella. He died at the age of thirty two from wounds he received fighting the Spanish at Zutphen, on his brother the Earl of Leicester's expedition. His sister Mary Herbert would oversee the publication of the manuscripts of his poems.

The daughter of Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon, Mary fell from favour during her parents' divorce and was declared illegitimate. By 1544 she was reinstated in the order of succession to the throne. On the death of her half brother Edward VI she inherited the throne, and as a fervent Roman Catholic, re-introduced the old religion. Yet her marriage to Philip II of Spain and persecution of Protestants contributed to her unpopularity. It was claimed that her unhappiness at Philip's absence abroad, and at the loss of Calais in the war against France contributed to her final illness.

Daughter of James V of Scotland and Mary of Guise, Mary spent her childhood in France, marrying Francis II in 1558. Following his early death, she returned to Scotland, ruling for seven years. Her marriage to Lord Darnley produced her only child, later James I of England and VI of Scotland, but ended in Darnley's murder in 1567. Mary later married the Earl of Bothwell who was implicated in Darnley's death. Forced to abdicate in favour of her son, she fled to England. As Elizabeth's immediate heir to the throne, she became the focus for Roman Catholic rebellion and was a continual threat to the future of Protestant England. Declared guilty of treason in 1586, she was executed the following year.

The great-nephew of Richard III, and therefore of royal blood, Pole was favoured by Henry VIII. However, rather than accept Henry as head of the English Church, he chose exile abroad. While in exile he was appointed a cardinal in 1536 and was considered for papal office in 1549. Under Mary he returned to England as Archbishop of Canterbury but arguably failed to fully restore the country to Catholicism."

Henry VIII succeeded his father Henry VII to the throne in 1509. He is well known for his six marriages, and for ordering the dissolution of religious houses which took place between 1535-39. Aided by his ministers, Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell, his reign was characterised by ambition abroad and ruthlessness at home, firmly establishing the Tudor family as the ruling dynasty in England. His quest for a male heir and a divorce from his first wife Katherine of Aragon, led to his establishing himself as head of the Church in England in place of the Pope in 1535.

Born in Devon, Drake went to sea at a young age and earned his fame and fortune by skill and piracy against the Spanish. In 1557 he and his cousin John Hawkins sailed to Africa and became England’s earliest recorded slave traders. After leading two expeditions to the West Indies, Queen Elizabeth I granted him a privateer’s commission, effectively authorising him to plunder Spanish ports in the West Indies. In 1577 Elizabeth commissioned him to lead an expedition to South America through the Straights of Magellan. Drake’s ship, the Pelican (later renamed the Golden Hind) was the only ship to reach the Pacific. He arrived back in Plymouth in 1580, becoming the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe. In 1585 he commanded a fleet of 25 ships and sailed to the West Indies, plundering Spanish ports and taking Santiago in the Cape Verde Islands, Cartagena in Colombia, St. Augustine in Florida and San Domingo in the Dominican Republic. In 1588, Drake served as second-in-command to Admiral Charles Howard in the English victory over the Spanish fleet, known as the Spanish Armada. In 1596 Elizabeth enlisted him for another voyage against Spain in the West Indies, but it failed. He died off the coast of Panama and was buried at sea.

A lover of literature, he is the only known patron of Shakespeare, and in 1593 Shakespeare dedicated the witty and erotic poem Venus and Adonis to him. Southampton's tempestuous relationship with the Queen culminated in his involvement in the Essex rebellion in 1601 with his close friend the Earl of Essex. He was condemned to death when the rebellion failed, but his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment and he was released by James I.

A lawyer, philosopher, essayist and scientist, Bacon was one of the great intellectual figures of Jacobean England. He was appointed Lord Chancellor in 1618, but was impeached for bribery three years later and confessed to 'corruption' and 'neglect', ending his political career. He spent the rest of his life in retirement, to devote himself to scientific research, which has led him to be regarded as the father of experimental science in this country. He published Essays (1597), Advancement of Learning (1605), Novum Organum (1620) and many other works.

A Flemish artist, engraver and cartographer. He is best known for his early maps of the New World and Europe and for his portraits of Francis Drake. He helped establish Amsterdam as the centre of cartography in Europe in the seventeenth century. Hondius moved to London in 1583 where he worked engraving maps and charts with information brought back from mariners. His work for the map publisher Edward Wright brought him into contact with great explorers including Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Ralegh. He engraved the copper plates for the first terrestrial globes made in England. He returned to Amsterdam in 1593 and established a thriving business producing terrestrial and celestial globes."

In spite of his bold opposition to the Acts of Supremacy and Allegiance (1559 and 1562), which seriously threatened the religious activities of the Roman Catholics, he never lost Elizabeth's favour.

Humanist scholar and author of Utopia, which aimed to encourage the reform of English politics. The dialogues satirised European society and included the famous description of the newly discovered island of Utopia - a name derived from the Greek for 'nowhere'. The argument that statesmen need to adopt an indirect approach in order to steer policy, in a manner 'that adapts itself to the play in hand', is one of the defining precepts of humanist political philosophy. More became Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor in 1529. He opposed the King's divorce from Katherine of Aragon and refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, which acknowledged Henry as head of the Church of England. He was executed for treason in 1535 and canonised by the Catholic Church in 1935.

Hastings was educated alongside the future Edward VI, and the two men remained close as adults. In 1553, Hastings married Catherine Dudley, daughter of the Duke of Northumberland, whose sister-in-law was Lady Jane Grey. When Queen Mary succeeded to the throne after Jane's brief reign, this alliance caused Hastings to be imprisoned in the Tower of London. After his release he continued to be a supporter of Mary and then of Elizabeth I. In 1572 he was appointed president of the Council of the North. During the troubled period between the flight of Mary to England in 1568 and the defeat of the Spanish Armada he was frequently employed in the north of England."

Lady Arabella was a cousin of James I and next in the line of succession after his children. When she received a letter from Lord Cobham in 1603 announcing a plan to murder James I and place her on the throne, she laughed and handed it to the king. However, her secret marriage to William Seymour in 1610 so angered James that he sent her to the Tower of London where she died in September 1615.

Appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1533 following the death of William Warham, it was Cranmer who secured Henry VIII's divorce from Katherine of Aragon later the same year. In the reign of Edward VI he was responsible for the first Book of Common Prayer, published in 1549. As a committed Protestant, Cranmer was deprived of office under the Roman Catholic Mary I and tried for treason. He eventually acknowledged Papal supremacy and the truth of Roman Catholic doctrines except for transubstantiation, but recanted just before his execution.

Educated at the Universities of St Andrews and Paris, Buchanan taught in Paris until his return to Scotland in 1536. Condemned as a heretic, he was imprisoned in the castle of St Andrews before escaping to France in 1539. He held professorships at Bordeaux and Paris, and later at Coimbra, Portugal, where he was put on trial for heresy in 1550-01. He returned to Scotland in 1561 and tutored Mary, Queen of Scots. Initially loyal to the Queen, he later testified against her at her trial for the assassination of her husband, Lord Darnley. He became principal of St Leonard's College in St Andrews in 1566. His most substantial work, Rerum Scoticarum Historia, a history of Scotland, was published in 1582."
