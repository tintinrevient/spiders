Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury;1500;Noblewoman;['mw123655.jpg', 'mw05579.jpg'];The niece of both Edward IV and Richard III, Margaret Pole was one of the last surviving members of the House of York. A member of Katherine of Aragon's household and later governess to Princess Mary, (later Mary I), Margaret openly supported Katherine and her daughter following Henry VIII's decision to annul his marriage. The Pole family's association with the pro-papal activities of Margaret's son Reginald (later cardinal) eventually led to her attainder and execution for treason. She was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church in 1886.

He organised and financed a number of expeditions to North America, and in later life made several unsuccessful attempts to find gold in South America. The family home was at Sherborne Castle, in Dorset. Implicated in a plotting against James I, Ralegh spent much of the Kings reign in the Tower. He was executed for treason in 1618.

She was named Catalina (or Katherine as she was known in England) after her maternal great-grandmother. She came to England in 1501, aged fifteen, to marry Arthur, Prince of Wales, but only months after the marriage Arthur died. In 1509 she married Arthur's younger brother, Henry VIII. They had five children, of whom only Princess Mary, later Mary I of England, survived. Katherine died in 1536, firm in her refusal to relinquish her title as queen of England, despite Henry VIII's annulment of their union and remarriage to Anne Boleyn in 1533.
Katherine Parr;1500;Sixth Queen of Henry VIII;['mw85445.jpg', 'mw138551.jpg', 'mw280429.jpg', 'mw136443.jpg', 'mw124785.jpg', 'mw01147.jpg', 'mw124781.jpg', 'mw01957.jpg', 'mw124783.jpg', 'mw124784.jpg', 'mw140845.jpg'];Henry VIII's sixth and last wife was a learned and pious woman, who had a moderating influence on the ageing king. Katherine showed great kindness to the king's children by his earlier marriages (Mary, Elizabeth and Edward), and tried to diminish religious persecution. After Henry's death, she married Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley in 1547, but she died a year later, shortly after giving birth to a daughter.

Left England in 1553, but corresponded with him in Strasburg and later in Zurich."
Jahangir;1500;Ruler of the Mughal Empire;['mw219460.jpg'];"Prince Salim, later known by his imperial name Jahangir, ('Conqueror of the World'), was the fourth Mughal Emperor who reigned for 22 years until his death in 1625. Born in Fatehpur Sikri to Emperor Akbar and Jodha Bai, he was named after Sheikh Salim Chisti, a holy man whose spiritual help was sought by Akbar to conceive a son after the death of his previous heirs in infancy. During Jahangir's reign the Mughal Empire expanded and flourished. Though a Muslim, his personal beliefs did not obstruct state policies. Sovereignty, according to Jahangir's memoirs was a ""gift of God"" to ""ensure the contentment of the world"" and not necessarily to enforce God's law. Notable for his patronage of the arts, the distinctive style of Mughal miniature painting was popularised under his reign. Jahangir's majestic mausoleum is located in Lahore. He was succeeded by his son Prince Khurram who took the title of Shah Jahan ('King of the World')."
King James I of England and VI of Scotland;1500;Reigned Scotland 1567-1625 and England 1603-25;['mw136443.jpg', 'mw03416.jpg', 'mw128073.jpg', 'mw81655.jpg', 'mw80486.jpg', 'mw128071.jpg', 'mw126502.jpg', 'mw70161.jpg', 'mw128072.jpg', 'mw03419.jpg', 'mw128077.jpg', 'mw128078.jpg', 'mw03417.jpg', 'mw03415.jpg', 'mw80505.jpg', 'mw03418.jpg', 'mw70621.jpg', 'mw126501.jpg', 'mw128079.jpg', 'mw128076.jpg'];The son of Mary, Queen of Scots and Lord Darnley, James was crowned King of Scotland in 1567, at the age of one on the abdication of his mother, and the country was run until his majority by a succession of Protestant Regents. He succeeded Elizabeth I in 1603. His commitment to peace and reconciliation balanced religious divisions, and he successfully held the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland together under one ruler for the first time. Intelligent and scholarly, his greatest act of cultural patronage was probably the 'King James' translation of the Bible (1611). James's financial incompetence and his devotion to a succession of male favourites fuelled his critics, particularly after his death.

He was chosen Master of University College in 1597, and appointed Dean of Westminster in 1600. Abbot was three times Vice Chancellor of the university, and took a leading part in preparing the authorised version of the New Testament. In 1608 he went to Scotland with George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar to arrange for a union between the churches of England and Scotland. He so pleased King James in this affair that he was made Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry in 1609 and was translated to the see of London a month afterwards. The following year Abbot was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury.

Their aim was to kill the king and most of the Protestant aristocracy by blowing up the Houses of Parliament during the state opening on 5 November 1605. Fawkes was by profession a soldier, who had fought for the armies of Catholic Spain in the Netherlands. He was recruited by Robert Catesby, the lead figure in devising the plan, because of his military experience. The plot was foiled shortly before its intended completion, as Fawkes was captured while guarding the gunpowder. On discovery, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, tried for treason and executed.

The latter induced Edward to will the crown to Lady Jane Grey, in order to ensure the Protestant succession. Edward died of tuberculosis shortly before his sixteenth birthday.

However, his ambition and pro-Catholic interests meant he became the focus of plots and religious dissent, which ultimately led to his downfall.

He was executed for treason in 1572.

Stuart was naturalised as an English citizen at James' accession to the English throne in 1603, and was installed as a knight of the Garter. His magnificent tomb can be seen in the King Henry VII Chapel, Westminster Abbey.

After two years of treacherous dealings against the Irish and the Scots living in Ulster, he was recalled to England. Before leaving, Essex carried out his most notorious act, a massacre on the island of Rathlin. He died of dysentery shortly after his return to England. Essex was the father of Robert Devereux, the 2nd Earl.
Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex;1500;Soldier, favourite of Elizabeth I;['mw194620.jpg', 'mw126585.jpg', 'mw126613.jpg', 'mw02131.jpg', 'mw09281.jpg', 'mw126579.jpg', 'mw112705.jpg', 'mw123963.jpg', 'mw112709.jpg', 'mw112707.jpg', 'mw112698.jpg', 'mw126612.jpg', 'mw126611.jpg', 'mw02132.jpg', 'mw02133.jpg', 'mw112691.jpg', 'mw112703.jpg', 'mw80474.jpg', 'mw194619.jpg', 'mw130554.jpg'];Elizabeth I's last favourite. Described as having 'a nature not to be ruled', Essex organised royal entertainment in his capacity as Master of the Horse. Confirmed as a popular hero when he took Cadiz in 1596, he lost his place at court as a result of his activities in Ireland in 1599. He tried to raise a rebellion against the queen's ministers in 1601, which failed, and he was executed for treason.

She was brought up with, and was a lifelong friend to, King Henry VIII's daughter by Katherine of Aragon, Princes Mary, later Queen Mary I. After Mary's death and the succession of Protestant Queen Elizabeth I in 1558, Margaret Douglas retired from Westminster Palace to Yorkshire, where she became involved with Roman Catholic plotting. In 1566 Elizabeth sent her to the Tower, but after the murder of her son Darnley in 1567 she was released. She was again imprisoned in 1574 when her son Charles married without royal permission and was pardoned after his death in 1577."

Born in Stratford-upon-Avon, he spent most of his working life in London, first as an actor, then a playwright. Whereas many poets of the time were wealthy amateurs, dramatists were usually professionals whose income came from supplying plays to the public theatres and court. The texts of plays belonged to the theatres and were seen as ephemeral, soon to be replaced. The publication of Ben Jonson's Workes in 1616, and in 1623 his own Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, Tragedies (the 'First Folio'), were milestones in the recognition of plays as lasting, influential works of literature.

He became Bishop of Rochester in 1547 and Bishop of London in 1550 and he committed himself to the reform of religion. In an attempt to ensure a Protestant succession, following the death of Edward VI, he denounced Mary I and Princess Princess Elizabeth as illegitimate, and supported Lady Jane Grey. On Mary's accession he was sent to the Tower, declared a heretic and burnt at the stake in Oxford.
Robert Catesby;1500;Leader of the Gunpowder plot;['mw00381.jpg', 'mw133799.jpg', 'mw133798.jpg', 'mw91293.jpg', 'mw233892.jpg', 'mw91296.jpg', 'mw91014.jpg', 'mw80901.jpg'];Robert Catesby was born in Lapworth, Warwickshire, to a strongly Roman Catholic family. In 1601 he sided with the Earl of Essex in the latter's doomed rebellion. He was wounded, imprisoned and fined £3,000 for his part in this affair. Catesby was the leader of a group of Roman Catholic conspirators (the most famous of whom was Guy Fawkes) who endeavoured to blow up the Houses of Parliament on 5 November 1605. The plot was uncovered, the gunpowder defused, and Catesby was shot three days later.

He was trained as a barrister at the Inns of Court and attained the highest and most prestigious order of counsel, namely, serjeant-at-law. He was appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1578 and served Queen Elizabeth I until 1593. Manwood was a notable philanthropist, having provided a significant amount of money for the foundation of Sir Roger Manwood's School in Sandwich, Kent, a free school to bring education to the townspeople whose families could not afford it.

A deeply religious man, he subsequently made an offer of marriage to Elizabeth after Mary's death, with the proviso that she must convert to Roman Catholicism. He was reluctant to go to war against England thirty years later, and claimed that his motivation was the re-conversion of the country to Catholicism. However, issues of reputation and defence were of equal, if not greater, importance.

The wedding was encouraged by Thomas Cromwell and the House of Cleves, both seeking a strong alliance in Europe. Hans Holbein the Younger was sent to paint portraits of Anne and her sister for Henry's consideration, who came to consider the likeness poor and complain that she was plain and uneducated. Despite his resistance, the marriage went ahead on January 6 1540, but was annulled on the grounds that it was unconsummated in July of the same year. Anne received Hever House in the settlement and remained on good terms with Henry, often being referred to as the King's beloved sister.

During her time in Scotland she converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism, but James allowed her to practise in private, and her early life with him was relatively happy. Anne and James had seven children, although only Henry, Elizabeth and Charles lived beyond early childhood. In England, Anne made an important contribution to the social and cultural life at court, commissioning artists and writers - most notably Ben Jonson, composers and choreographers, as well as collecting art, particularly portraiture.

She was the elder sister of Henry VIII. In 1503 she married James IV, King of Scots, thus becoming the mother of James V and grandmother of Mary, Queen of Scots. Importantly, Margaret's marriage to James led directly to the Union of the Crowns. Margaret was married three times, and her history in this regard might be said to parallel that of her granddaughter, Mary Stuart, with its liberal mixture of tragedy, intrigue, duplicity and simple farce.

In Elizabeth's reign he was an active member of the Council of the North, served as ambassador extraordinary and travelled to France for the investiture of Henry III with the Order of the Garter, which was one of the largest embassies ever sent by the Tudor monarchs. The diary of his time treating for peace with Spain with Alessandro Farnese in 1588 survives in the British Library (BL Sloane MS 262). He is of particular interest as an early patron of poets, actors, and wrestlers, and financed a company of actors called 'Derby's Men', one of the earliest troupes of their kind.

He died at the age of thirty two from wounds he received fighting the Spanish at Zutphen, on his brother the Earl of Leicester's expedition. His sister Mary Herbert would oversee the publication of the manuscripts of his poems.

By 1544 she was reinstated in the order of succession to the throne. On the death of her half brother Edward VI she inherited the throne, and as a fervent Roman Catholic, re-introduced the old religion. Yet her marriage to Philip II of Spain and persecution of Protestants contributed to her unpopularity. It was claimed that her unhappiness at Philip's absence abroad, and at the loss of Calais in the war against France contributed to her final illness.

Following his early death, she returned to Scotland, ruling for seven years. Her marriage to Lord Darnley produced her only child, later James I of England and VI of Scotland, but ended in Darnley's murder in 1567. Mary later married the Earl of Bothwell who was implicated in Darnley's death. Forced to abdicate in favour of her son, she fled to England. As Elizabeth's immediate heir to the throne, she became the focus for Roman Catholic rebellion and was a continual threat to the future of Protestant England. Declared guilty of treason in 1586, she was executed the following year.

However, rather than accept Henry as head of the English Church, he chose exile abroad. While in exile he was appointed a cardinal in 1536 and was considered for papal office in 1549. Under Mary he returned to England as Archbishop of Canterbury but arguably failed to fully restore the country to Catholicism.

He is well known for his six marriages, and for ordering the dissolution of religious houses which took place between 1535-39. Aided by his ministers, Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell, his reign was characterised by ambition abroad and ruthlessness at home, firmly establishing the Tudor family as the ruling dynasty in England. His quest for a male heir and a divorce from his first wife Katherine of Aragon, led to his establishing himself as head of the Church in England in place of the Pope in 1535.

In 1557 he and his cousin John Hawkins sailed to Africa and became England’s earliest recorded slave traders. After leading two expeditions to the West Indies, Queen Elizabeth I granted him a privateer’s commission, effectively authorising him to plunder Spanish ports in the West Indies. In 1577 Elizabeth commissioned him to lead an expedition to South America through the Straights of Magellan. Drake’s ship, the Pelican (later renamed the Golden Hind) was the only ship to reach the Pacific. He arrived back in Plymouth in 1580, becoming the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe. In 1585 he commanded a fleet of 25 ships and sailed to the West Indies, plundering Spanish ports and taking Santiago in the Cape Verde Islands, Cartagena in Colombia, St. Augustine in Florida and San Domingo in the Dominican Republic. In 1588, Drake served as second-in-command to Admiral Charles Howard in the English victory over the Spanish fleet, known as the Spanish Armada. In 1596 Elizabeth enlisted him for another voyage against Spain in the West Indies, but it failed. He died off the coast of Panama and was buried at sea.

The dialogues satirised European society and included the famous description of the newly discovered island of Utopia - a name derived from the Greek for 'nowhere'. The argument that statesmen need to adopt an indirect approach in order to steer policy, in a manner 'that adapts itself to the play in hand', is one of the defining precepts of humanist political philosophy. More became Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor in 1529. He opposed the King's divorce from Katherine of Aragon and refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, which acknowledged Henry as head of the Church of England. He was executed for treason in 1535 and canonised by the Catholic Church in 1935.

When Queen Mary succeeded to the throne after Jane's brief reign, this alliance caused Hastings to be imprisoned in the Tower of London. After his release he continued to be a supporter of Mary and then of Elizabeth I. In 1572 he was appointed president of the Council of the North. During the troubled period between the flight of Mary to England in 1568 and the defeat of the Spanish Armada he was frequently employed in the north of England.

As a committed Protestant, Cranmer was deprived of office under the Roman Catholic Mary I and tried for treason. He eventually acknowledged Papal supremacy and the truth of Roman Catholic doctrines except for transubstantiation, but recanted just before his execution.
